# Notara — Floating Sticky Notes for Any Website

> Pin notes directly on web pages, right where you found the info.

## The Problem

You find information online — but you lose it. Bookmarks pile up untouched, tabs close before you're done, and the context around *why* something mattered vanishes. Copy-pasting into a separate app means switching windows, losing your place, and adding friction to a simple thought: "I want to remember this."

## The Solution

Notara lets you pin sticky notes directly on any web page. Notes stay exactly where you left them — on the article, the product page, the GitHub issue. Come back days or weeks later and your notes are still there, in context.

No tab-switching. No separate app. Just your thoughts, anchored to the web.

## Use Cases

### 1. The Researcher

You're writing a report and have 15 tabs open — articles, papers, documentation. You need to track sources, extract key points, and flag action items, but everything blurs together.

With Notara, you drop color-coded notes directly on each page:
- **Blue** notes for sources and citations
- **Yellow** for key takeaways
- **Green** for action items

When it's time to write, open the **Global Panel** to see every note organized by site. All your research in one view, each note linked to exactly where you found it. Capture a screenshot of a chart or table and embed it right in the note — no more "which page was that graph on?"

### 2. The Project Manager

Your work lives across GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Notion, Google Docs. You jump between them constantly and things slip through the cracks.

Pin a **reminder** on a GitHub PR: *"Review before standup — tomorrow 9 AM."* Notara fires a notification at exactly that time. Add a **site-scoped note** on your Jira board with the sprint priorities — it shows up on every page in Jira, not just one ticket.

Notes persist on the exact pages where work happens. No context-switching to a task manager. Open the Global Panel and see everything you've pinned across all your tools, grouped by domain.

### 3. The Everyday Browser

You're comparing laptops across three retailer sites. You pin notes with prices, specs, and your gut reactions: *"Best keyboard but $200 over budget."* A week later, you come back — notes are still there.

Planning a trip? Pin hotel options, restaurant recommendations, flight details directly on the booking pages. Saving a recipe? Drop a note on the ingredients you'd substitute.

Pin a note on a product page — *"Wait for Black Friday sale"* — and come back weeks later. It's still there.
