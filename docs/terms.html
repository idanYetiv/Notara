    <h1>Terms of Service — Notara</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 24, 2026</p>

    <p class="intro">These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Notara Chrome extension ("Extension", "Service") developed by ISYappStudio ("we", "us", "our"). By installing or using Notara, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please uninstall the Extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing, accessing, or using Notara, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. We may update these Terms from time to time, and continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>Notara is a Chrome browser extension that allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create floating sticky notes on any website</li>
      <li>Color-code and organize notes visually</li>
      <li>Capture screenshots and attach them to notes</li>
      <li>Set alert reminders on individual notes</li>
      <li>View and manage all notes from a global panel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notes are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage API. The Extension does not host or store your note content on external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>Notara offers optional Google sign-in via Supabase authentication. When you sign in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Google profile information (name, email, profile picture) is used to personalize your experience within the Extension.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account.</li>
      <li>You must not share your account or allow others to access the Extension through your credentials.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may use Notara without signing in, but certain features may require authentication.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Extension for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Extension</li>
      <li>Modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Extension</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Extension</li>
      <li>Use automated tools to interact with the Extension in unintended ways</li>
      <li>Circumvent any technical limitations or access restrictions</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Pricing &amp; Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Notara is currently available as a <strong>free</strong> extension with a limit of 20 notes. We may introduce paid plans in the future to unlock additional features or higher limits. If we do:</p>

      <li>The Extension will be compatible with all websites or browser configurations</li>
      <li>Any defects will be corrected in a specific timeframe</li>

    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the Extension shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or $0 if you are using the free version.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p><strong>By you:</strong> You may stop using Notara at any time by uninstalling the Extension from your browser. Uninstalling removes all locally stored data, including your notes.</p>
    <p><strong>By us:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Extension if you violate these Terms or engage in abusive behavior. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you before any such action, except in cases of severe or repeated violations.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the effective date at the top of this page. Continued use of the Extension after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
    <p>For significant changes, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice through the Extension or other means.</p>
