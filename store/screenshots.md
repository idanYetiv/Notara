All screenshots: **1280 x 800 px**, PNG format.

---

## Screenshot 1 — Hero Shot
**What to capture:** The floating panel open on a real, visually appealing website (e.g., a blog or docs page). Show 2–3 notes in the panel list with different colors.
**Tips:**
- Use a site with clean, readable content as background
- Panel should be open and populated with realistic notes
- Show the dark theme + cyan accents clearly

## Screenshot 2 — Sign-In Screen
**What to capture:** The panel in its signed-out state showing "Welcome to Notara" and the Google sign-in button.
**Tips:**
- Use a neutral background website
- Panel should be centered and clearly readable

## Screenshot 3 — Note Editing
**What to capture:** A note expanded in edit mode. Show the color picker, some typed text, and the scope toggle (page vs. global).
**Tips:**
- Fill the note with realistic content (e.g., "Follow up on project proposal — check budget numbers before Friday meeting")
- Show a non-default color selected in the picker

## Screenshot 4 — Alerts
**What to capture:** The panel showing notes with scheduled alerts, ideally one with an active/upcoming alert time visible.
**Tips:**
- Set a realistic alert time on a note
- Show the alert icon or scheduled time clearly

## Screenshot 5 — Minimized FAB
**What to capture:** A clean website with only the floating action button (FAB circle) visible in the corner, panel closed.
**Tips:**
- Use a visually clean website to keep focus on the FAB
- Show how unobtrusive the extension is when not in use

## Promo Image (Small Tile)
**Size:** 440 x 280 px, PNG

**Design guidance:**
- Notara logo/icon centered or left-aligned
- Tagline: "Sticky notes on any website"
- Dark background (#1a1a2e or similar) with cyan (#00d4ff) accent
- Keep it simple — icon + tagline, no busy screenshots
- Ensure text is readable at small sizes

## How to Capture

1. Load the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions` → Load unpacked → `dist/`)

3. Use Chrome DevTools device toolbar or a screenshot tool to capture at exact 1280x800
4. Crop/resize in an image editor if needed
5. Save as PNG with descriptive filenames: `screenshot-1-hero.png`, `screenshot-2-signin.png`, etc.
